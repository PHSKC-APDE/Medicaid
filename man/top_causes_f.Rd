\description{
\code{top_causes_f} identifies the top N causes for a given set of visits.
}
\details{
This function builds a temp table with the IDs of a cohort of interest.
It then creates a SQL query to find claims for that cohort made in a given time frame
The top N categories are selected and a count of the claims in each category given.
There are optional flags for the following:
1) To limit categories to just the primary dx vs. all dx.
2) To restrict to certain visit types (e.g., ED visits, hospitalizations)

# Medicaid eligibility and claims stores procedures

This folder contains SQL scripts used to generate stored procedures that return extracts of Medicaid eligibility and/or claims data. These stored procedures are run by the <i>medicaid</i> package in R, which is described [here](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/Medicaid/blob/master/README.md#medicaid).

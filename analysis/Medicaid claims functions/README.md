# Medicaid eligibility and claims stored procedures

## Purpose
This folder contains stored procedures that return extracts of Medicaid eligibility and/or claims data from SQL Server. The *medicaid* R package, described [here](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/Medicaid#medicaid) calls these stored procedures to return such extracts to R.

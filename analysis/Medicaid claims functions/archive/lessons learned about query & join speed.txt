for elig cohort function:

-creating indexes (on ID for joins, and variables used in where clauses) yielded no performance improvement
-casting dualper and covper as decimals, ints or floats yielded no performance improvement

-in the end the culprit behind the slow query speed when the where statement for dualmax was added was that an "=" was
used. once i changed to a "<=" sign, the performance issue disappeared

-i also (on 5/10/18) tried reorganizing the medicaid cohort function script so that 4 temp tables are created and
then joined at end - this did NOT result in any speed performance and thus i did not make any changes
